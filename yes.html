                    Please don't doubt my love for you, it's the only thing I'm sure of. You're special to me.
                    You're the only one who I wouldn't mind losing sleep for, the only one who I can never get tired of talking to,
                    and the only one who crosses my mind constantly throughout the day. You're the only one who can make me smile without trying,
                    bring down my mood without the intention to and affect my emotions with every action of yours. You're the one I'm 
                    afraid of losing and the one I want to keep in my life. But whatever the answer is kr vea laor jeang ot ban sur
